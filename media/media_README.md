# Analysis Report

### Dataset Summary

The dataset from **media.csv** consists of **2,652** records across **8** columns, encompassing various attributes related to media entries. The columns included are:
- **date**: Publication or release date of the media
- **language**: Language of the media
- **type**: Type of media (e.g., movie, show)
- **title**: Title of the media
- **by**: Creator or author of the media
- **overall**: Overall rating (scale not specified, but likely from 1 to 5)
- **quality**: Quality rating (scale not specified, likely from 1 to 5)
- **repeatability**: Repeatability rating (scale not specified, likely from 1 to 3)

#### Missing Values
The dataset has missing values in the following columns:
- **date**: 99 missing entries
- **by**: 262 missing entries

#### Summary Statistics
- The **date** column has **2553** non-null entries with **2055** unique dates, indicating a diverse range of media releases.
- The **language** column shows a predominance of English entries, accounting for **1306** occurrences out of **2652**.
- The **type** column is heavily weighted towards movies, with **2211** entries categorized as such.
- The **overall** rating averages about **3.05**, while the **quality** rating averages **3.21**. This suggests that most media items are rated positively but with room for improvement.
- The **repeatability** rating averages **1.49**, indicating that most media is not rated highly for repeat viewing.

### Key Insights
1. **Dominance of Movies**: The dataset is predominantly composed of movies, which may skew the analysis if users are interested in other types of media.
2. **English Language Prevalence**: With over half of the entries in English, insights derived might not reflect a global media perspective.
3. **High Ratings**: Both overall and quality ratings suggest that the media is generally well-received, but the relatively low repeatability rating indicates that while media may be good, it might not be engaging enough for audiences to watch multiple times.
4. **Missing Data**: The significant number of missing values in the 'by' column could affect analysis related to creators and authorship, implying a need for data cleaning.

### Recommendations
1. **Data Cleaning**: Address the missing values, particularly in the 'date' and 'by' columns. This could involve removing rows with missing data or inferring values where possible.
2. **Expand the Dataset**: Consider including more diverse media types and languages to provide a more holistic view of the media landscape.
3. **Analyze Viewer Engagement**: Further investigate why repeatability ratings are low. This may involve qualitative methods, such as surveys or focus groups, to understand viewer preferences.
4. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to depict the distribution of ratings and the languages/types of media to provide clearer insights at a glance.

By taking these steps, the dataset can be enhanced for better analysis and understanding of the media landscape.
